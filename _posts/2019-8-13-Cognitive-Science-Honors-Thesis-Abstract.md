#### Abstract

*In vivo estimation of structural connectivity in the acoustic radiation with diffusion imaging: Method and validation*

Non-invasive imaging of the acoustic radiation (AR) is crucial to understanding clinical populations that may have structural deficiencies that lead to loss of auditory processing. Prior attempts in mapping the AR have failed due to the complicated “s-shape” and large crossing fiber tracts. The purpose of this study is to create an automatic procedure to estimate the structural connectivity of the AR in vivo, using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and probabilistic tractography. To our knowledge, it will be the first application of the advances constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) method of tractography for the probabilistic reconstruction of the AR.
